<p class="pr1"><b><big>Longtree played. His features relaxed into a gentle smile
of happiness and his body turned a bright red orange.</big></b></p></div>

<p><span class="dcap">Longtree</span> sat before his
hole in the ground and gazed
thoughtfully among the
sandy red hills that surrounded
him. His skin at that
moment was a medium yellow,
a shade between pride
and happiness at having his
brief symphony almost completed,
with just a faint tinge
of red to denote that uncertain,
cautious approach to the
last note which had eluded
him thus far.</p>

<p>He sat there unmoving for
a while, and then he picked
up his blowstring and fitted
the mouthpiece between his
thin lips. He blew into it
softly and at the same time
gently strummed the three
strings stretching the length
of the instrument. The note
was a firm clear one which
would have made any other
musician proud.</p>

<p>But Longtree frowned, and
at the disappointment his
body flushed a dark green
and began taking on a purple
cast of anger. Hastily, he put
down the blowstring and
tried to think of something
else. Slowly his normal color
returned.</p>

<p>Across the nearest hill
came his friend Channeljumper,
striding on the long
thin ungainly legs that had
given him his name. His skin
radiated a blissful orange.</p>

<p>"Longtree!" Channeljumper
exclaimed enthusiastically,
collapsing on the
ground nearby and folding
his legs around him. "How's
the symphony coming?"</p>

<p>"Not so good," Longtree
admitted sadly, and his skin
turned green at the memory.
"If I don't get that last note,
I may be this color the rest
of my life."</p>

<p>"Why don't you play what
you've written so far. It's not
very long, and it might cheer
you up a bit."</p>

<p>You're a good friend, Channeljumper,
Longtree thought,
and when Redsand and I are
married after the Music Festival
we'll have you over to
our hole for dinner. As he
thought this, he felt his body
take on an orange cast, and
he felt better.</p>

<p>"I can't seem to get that
last note," he said, picking up
the blowstring again and putting
it into position. "The
final note must be conclusive,
something complete in itself
and yet be able to sum up the
entire meaning of the symphony
preceding it."</p>

<p>Channeljumper hummed
sympathetically. "That's a big
job for one note. It might be
a sound no one has ever heard
before."</p>

<p>Longtree shrugged. "It may
even sound <i>alien</i>," he admitted,
"but it's got to be the
right note."</p>

<p>"Play, and we'll see," Channeljumper
urged.</p>

<p>Longtree played. And as he
played, his features relaxed
into a gentle smile of happiness
and his body turned orange.
Delicately, he strummed
the three strings of the blowstring
with his long-nailed
fingers, softly he pursed his
frail lips and blew expertly
into the mouthpiece.</p>

<p>From the instrument came
sounds the like of which
Channeljumper had never before
heard. The Martian sat
and listened in evident rapture,
his body radiating a
golden glow of ecstasy. He
sat and dreamed, and as the
music played, his spine tingled
with growing excitement.
The music swelled, surrounding
him, permeating
him, picking him up in a
great hand and sweeping
him into new and strange and
beautiful worlds&mdash;worlds of
tall metal structures, of vast
stretches of greenness and of
water and of trees and of
small pale creatures that flew
giant metal insects. He
dreamed of these things which
his planet Mars had not
known for millions of years.</p>

<p>After a while, the music
stopped, but for a moment
neither of them said anything.</p>

<p>At last Channeljumper
sighed. "It's beautiful," he
said.</p>

<p>"Yes," Longtree admitted.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" Channeljumper
seemed puzzled&mdash;"but
somehow it doesn't seem complete.
Almost, but not quite.
As though&mdash;as though&mdash;"</p>

<p>Longtree sighed. "One
more note would do it. One
more note&mdash;no more, no less&mdash;at
the end of the crescendo
could tie the symphony together
and end it. But which
one? I've tried them all, and
none of them fit!"</p>

<p>His voice had risen higher
in his excitement, and Channeljumper
warned, "Careful,
you're beginning to turn purple."</p>

<p>"I know," Longtree said
mournfully, and the purple
tint changed to a more acceptable
green. "But I've got
to win first prize at the festival
tomorrow; Redsand promised
to marry me if I did."</p>

<p>"You can't lose," Channeljumper
told him, and then remembered,
"if you can get
that last note."</p>

<p>"If," Longtree echoed despairingly,
as though his
friend had asked the impossible.
"I wish I had your confidence,
Chan; you're orange
most of the time, while I'm a
spectrum."</p>

<p>"I haven't your artistic temperament,"
Channeljumper
told him. "Besides, orange is
such a homely color I feel
ashamed to have it all the
time."</p>

<p>As he said this, he turned
green with shame, and Longtree
laughed at the paradox.</p>

<p>Channeljumper laughed
too, glad that he had diverted
his friend's attention from the
elusive and perhaps non-existent
note. "Did you know
the space rocket is due pretty
soon," he said, "perhaps
even in time for the Music
Festival?"</p>

<p>"Space rocket?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I forgot you were
busy composing and didn't
get to hear about it," Channeljumper
said. "Well, Bigwind,
who has a telescope in
his hole, told me a rocket is
coming through space toward
us, possibly from the
third planet."</p>

<p>"Oh?" Longtree said, not
particularly interested.</p>

<p>"I wonder if they'll look
like us?" Channeljumper
wondered.</p>

<p>"If they're intelligent, of
course they will," Longtree
said certainly, not caring.
"Their culture will probably
be alien, though, and their
music&mdash;" He paused and
turned a very deep yellow.
"Of course! They might even
be able to furnish the note I
need to complete my symphony!"</p>

<p>Channeljumper shook his
head. "You've got to compose
it all yourself," he reminded,
"or you don't qualify.
And if you don't qualify,
you can't win, and if you
don't win, you can't marry
Redsand."</p>

<p>"But just one little note&mdash;"
Longtree said.</p>

<p>Channeljumper shrugged
helplessly and turned sympathetically
green. "I don't
make the rules," he said.</p>

<p>"No. Well," Longtree went
on in sudden determination,
"I'll find that last note if I
have to stay permanently
purple."</p>

<p>Channeljumper shuddered
jestingly at this but remained
pleasantly orange. "And I'll
leave you alone so you can
get to work," he said, unfolding
himself.</p>

<p>"Goodbye," Longtree said,
but Channeljumper's long
legs had already taken him
over to the nearest sand dune
and out of sight.</p>

<p>Alone, Longtree picked up
the blowstring once more,
placed it against his stomach,
and gave out with a clear,
beautiful, experimental note
which was again not the one
he desired.</p>

<p>He still had not found it an
hour later, when the Sound
came. The Sound was a low
unpleasant rumble, a sound
lower than any Longtree had
ever heard, and he wondered
what it was. Thinking of it,
he remembered he had seen a
large flash of fire in the sky
a moment before the roar
came. But since this last was
clearly not likely at all, he
dismissed the whole thing as
imagination and tried again to
coax some new note from the
blowstring.</p>

<p>A half hour later, Channeljumper
came bounding excitedly
over a sand dune.
"They're here," he cried,
screeching to a halt and emitting
yellow flashes of color.</p>

<p>"Who's here?" Longtree
demanded, turning violet in
annoyance at the interruption.</p>

<p>"The visitors from
space," Channeljumper explained.
"They landed near
my hole. They're little creatures,
only half as big as we
are, but thicker and grey
colored."</p>

<p>"Grey colored?" Longtree
repeated incredulously, trying
to picture the improbability.</p>

<p>"But only on the outside,"
Channeljumper went on.
"They have an outside shell
that comes off, and inside
they're sort of pink-orange."</p>

<p>"Ah-ha," Longtree said, as
though he'd suspected it all
the time. "Evidently they
wear grey suits of some kind,
probably for protection."</p>

<p>"They took them off anyway,"
Channeljumper said,
eager to impart his knowledge,
"and they were sort of
pink-orange underneath.
There are only two of them,
and one has long hair."</p>

<p>"Strange," Longtree mused,
thinking of their own hairless
bodies. "Wonder what they
want."</p>

<p>Channeljumper shrugged to
indicate he didn't know. "The
short-haired one followed
me," he said.</p>

<p>Longtree felt the chill blue
of fear creep along his spine,
but immediate anger at himself
changed it conveniently
to purple, and he was certain
Channeljumper hadn't noticed.
When he had controlled
himself, he said, "Well, it
doesn't matter. I've got to get
on with my symphony. That
last note&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He's here," Channeljumper
announced.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>Channeljumper pointed
eagerly, and Longtree's eyes
followed the direction to
where the alien stood at the
top of a nearby dune staring
at them. Longtree could feel
his skin automatically turning
red with caution, blending
with the sand while the
ever-trusting Channeljumper
remained bright orange.</p>

<p>"Good gosh," the alien exclaimed.
"Not only do they
look like modified grasshoppers,
they change color
too!"</p>

<p>"What'd he say?" Longtree
demanded.</p>

<p>"How should I know?"
Channeljumper said. "It's in
another language."</p>

<p>"And its voice," Longtree
exclaimed, almost disbelieving
it. "Low. Lower than
even our drums' rumble."</p>

<p>"And they talk in squeaks
yet!" the alien told himself
aloud.</p>

<p>Longtree regarded the alien
carefully. As Channeljumper
had said, the creature was
short and had close-cropped
hair on its head. The legs
were brief and pudgy, and
Longtree felt a shade of pity
for the creature who could
obviously not get around as
well as they. It was undoubtedly
intelligent&mdash;the space
rocket testified to that&mdash;and
the fact that the creature's
skin color stayed a peaceful
pink-orange helped assure
Longtree the alien's mission
was friendly.</p>

<p>The alien raised a short
arm and stepped slowly forward.
"I come in peace," he
said in the language they
could not understand. "My
wife and I are probably the
only humans left alive. When
we left Earth, most of the
population had been wiped out
by atomics. I think we were
the only ones to get away."</p>

<p>Longtree felt his redness
subside to orange, as he wondered
idly what the alien had
said. Except for a natural
curiosity, he didn't really
care, for he remembered suddenly
the symphony he had
to finish by tomorrow if he
were to marry Redsand. But
there was the element of politeness
to consider, so he
nudged Channeljumper.</p>

<p>"Don't just stand there,
say something!"</p>

<p>Channeljumper flustered
and turned several colors in
rapid succession. He stammered,
"Er&mdash;ah&mdash;welcome to
our planet, O visitor from
space," and motioned the alien
to sit down.</p>

<p>"That's not very creative,"
Longtree accused.</p>

<p>"What's the difference,"
Channeljumper pointed out,
"when he doesn't understand
us anyway."</p>

<p>"You guys don't really look
like grasshoppers," the man
from Earth apologized, coming
forward; "it's just the
long legs that fooled me from
up there. Boy, am I glad to
find somebody intelligent on
Mars; from the air we
couldn't see any cities or anything,
and we were afraid the
planet didn't have any life. I
wish we could understand
each other, though."</p>

<p>Longtree smiled pleasantly
and wished the creature
would go away so he could
search for the last note to his
symphony. He picked up his
blowstring so the alien
wouldn't sit on it.</p>

<p>"Play for him," Channeljumper
suggested, seating
himself by segments. "Just
the last part to see how he reacts.
Music is universal, you
know."</p>

<p>Longtree was going to do
just that thing, for despite
Channeljumper's warning that
he must compose every single
note by himself, he felt an
alien viewpoint might be
helpful.</p>

<p>He started playing. Channeljumper
sat dreaming,
glowing radiantly, but the
alien seemed somewhat perturbed
by the music and fidgeted
nervously. Could it be,
Longtree wondered, that the
incredible beauty of his composition
might not translate
acceptably to alien ears? He
dismissed the thought as unlikely.</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;that's a bit high, isn't
it?" the creature said, shaking
his head.</p>

<p>Lost in the sweeping melodies,
neither Longtree nor
Channeljumper paid any attention
to the meaningless
syllables. Longtree played on,
oblivious to all else, soaring
toward the great screaming
crescendo that would culminate
with the missing note.</p>

<p>Vaguely, he became aware
that the creature had gotten
up, and he turned a small part
of his attention to the action.
Longtree smiled inwardly,
pleased, and turned yellow
with pride to think even a
man from another planet
should so appreciate his symphony
that he got up and
danced a strange dance and
even sang to the music.</p>

<p>The alien held onto his
ears and leaped erratically,
singing, "No, no, stop it.
It's too high. My head's bursting!"</p>

<p>Channeljumper too seemed
pleased by this show of appreciation,
though neither of
them understood the words,
and Longtree swept into the
final notes of the rising crescendo
with a gusto he had
not previously displayed. He
stopped where he had always
stopped&mdash;and the final note
came!</p>

<p>It startled the Martians.
Then the realization swept
over them in glad tides of
color. The symphony was
complete now, with that final
alien sound. Longtree could
win both the festival prize
and Redsand with it. The
last note was a soft popping
sound that had come from the
creature from another planet.
They looked to see him sagging
to the ground, his head
soft and pulpy.</p>

<p>"My symphony's complete,"
Longtree exclaimed
jubilantly, a brilliant yellow
now.</p>

<p>But Channeljumper's yellow
happiness was tinged
with green. "A pity," he said,
"the creature had to give its
life in exchange for the note."</p>

<p>"I believe it really wanted
to," Longtree said, turning
solemn. "Did you see how it
danced to the music, as
though in the throes of ecstasy,
and it didn't change color
once! It must have died happy
to know it gave itself to a
good cause."</p>

<p>"You could probably get by
with claiming to use the
creature as an auxiliary instrument,"
mused Channeljumper,
practical once more,
"and eliminate any claim that
he might have assisted you.
But what about the Festival?
This one looks as though he
doesn't have another note in
him."</p>

<p>"There's the other one,"
Longtree reminded, "the one
with long hair. We can save
that one until tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Of course," Channeljumper
agreed, standing up. "I'll
go get it, and you can keep it
safe here in your hole until
tomorrow night."</p>

<p>"You're a good friend,
Channeljumper," Longtree
began, but the other was already
bounding out of sight
over a sand dune.</p>

<p>Blissfully he raised the
blowstring into position and
played the opening notes to
his symphony. The alien lay
unmoving with its head in a
sticky puddle, but Longtree
took no notice. He didn't even
consider that after the Festival
he would never be able to
play his symphony again in
all its glorious completeness.
His spinal column tingled
pleasantly, and his skin
turned the golden yellow of
unbearable happiness.</p>

<p>The music was beautiful.</p>
